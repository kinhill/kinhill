  "about_text": "Kin hill is about kinship and exploring relationship in all it’s dimensions. To ourselves, to each other, to the land and animals and to those yet to come that will call Kin Hill their home. We are addressing the current paradigm that humans are an extractive and separated species. We live into our interdependence with all beings remembering that humans can be a beneficial species. The land sustains and nourishes us, we too can nourish the land.",
  "community_text": "We host regular Community Days where you can come along and get involved in the Kin Hill Community. Depending on the season, activities include tree planting, compost turning, fruit picking, apple juicing, and building natural structures.",
  "studio_teaser": "Our studio is a light-filled, tranquil space designed for creativity, movement, and gathering. Nestled within the landscape, it offers the perfect environment for facilitators and artists."
